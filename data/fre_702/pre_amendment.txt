Rule 702. Testimony by Expert Witnesses

A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:

(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;

(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;

(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and

(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

Advisory Committee Note (2000):
This rule governs the admissibility of expert testimony. The trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable. The proponent of the evidence has the burden of establishing its admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence.

Effective Date: December 1, 2000
